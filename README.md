# Deep learning
This repository contains all the information related to a deep learning course that I'm doing. 

The main idea is to learn from A to Z how deep learning works. 

As I don't have a GPU I'll be using [Google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).

I'll be using Python, Tensorflow, Keras, Matplotlib, Scipy, Numpy, Pandas, etc...
